    ">"Welcome to our Tic Tac Toe game!</h1>
<div style="display:block; align-items: center; padding-left: 100px;">
    <p>A Tic Tac Toe game typically follows these basic rules:</p>
    <h2> Game Setup:</h2>
     . The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
     . Two players take turns to play: one is 'X' and the other is 'O'.

      <h2>Game Play:</h2>
      . Players take turns placing their marker (X or O) in an empty cell on the grid.
      . The first player to align three of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the round.
      . If all cells are filled without any player achieving a three-in-a-row, the game is considered a draw.

       <h2>Winning a Round:</h2>
       . A player wins a round by having three of their markers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

       <h2> Multiple Rounds:</h2>
       . If playing multiple rounds, keep track of the number of wins for each player.
       . After a predefined number of rounds (e.g., 3 rounds), the player with the most wins is declared the overall
       winner.
       . In case of a tie (equal number of wins), additional rounds can be played or the game can be declared a tie.

       <h2> the Game:</h2>
       . After completing the set number of rounds, the game board is reset to start a new series of rounds.
